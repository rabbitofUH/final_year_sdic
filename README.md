# final_year_sdic
This is the for final year project from sdic. 
#
The user menu to select:1 is dynamic time information, 2 is ggp value, 3 is check bond-broken
Then dynamic time information includes initial and finished time, timestep.
GGP value is indexed by the number of file and literation.
bond-broken is for two atoms that selected by users, then the distances between atoms are estimated through available "GGP",
then the plot of possibility is done. 
#
The user needs to select the task(1,2,3), for task 2, user needs to input the file number and literation. for task 3, user need to tell two number of atoms and certeria for bond-broken. 
Also the system will write the distances of atoms and possibility of bond-broken.
#
The code is interactive and different functions are called to deal with different files.
